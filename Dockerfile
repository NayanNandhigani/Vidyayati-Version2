# Production image — host-agnostic (Railway, Render, Fly.io; see
# Deployment.md for all options). Deliberately NOT using Next.js's
# "standalone" output mode — that mode prunes node_modules down to only
# what's traced from import/require statements, which drops the `prisma`
# CLI package (it's invoked via `npx prisma ...`, not imported, so Next's
# tracer never sees it) and would silently break scripts/migrate.sh's
# `prisma migrate deploy`, which every host's pre-deploy step runs against
# this same image before every deploy. Keeping the full node_modules costs
# image size, not correctness — a deliberate trade for "actually works"
# over "small."
